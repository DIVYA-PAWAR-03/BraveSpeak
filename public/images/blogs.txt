### **Breaking the Silence: Understanding Consent & Empowering Survivors**  

**Introduction**  
Consent is a basic human right, yet many misconceptions surround it. Understanding consent and breaking myths about sexual violence is crucial for creating a safe society.  

#### **What is Consent?**  
Consent means **freely agreeing** to any activity without pressure, fear, or manipulation. It should be:  
âœ… **Enthusiastic** â€“ A clear "Yes," not silence.  
âœ… **Ongoing** â€“ Can be withdrawn at any time.  
âœ… **Informed** â€“ Both individuals understand what they are agreeing to.  
âœ… **Voluntary** â€“ No force, threat, or intoxication involved.  

#### **Myths vs. Reality**  
ðŸš« *"No means Yes."* â†’ **No always means No.**  
ðŸš« *"If they didnâ€™t resist, it wasnâ€™t rape."* â†’ **Fear or shock can prevent a person from reacting.**  
ðŸš« *"They were drunk, so it doesnâ€™t count."* â†’ **A person under the influence cannot give valid consent.**  

#### **Why Survivors Stay Silent**  
Many survivors donâ€™t report due to:  
- **Fear of stigma** and victim-blaming.  
- **Lack of trust** in the legal system.  
- **Emotional trauma** and self-blame.  

#### **How to Support a Survivor**  
ðŸ’™ **Listen without judgment.** Let them share their story when theyâ€™re ready.  
ðŸ’™ **Believe them.** False accusations are rareâ€”support matters.  
ðŸ’™ **Encourage legal action.** Help them reach out to helplines or NGOs.  
ðŸ’™ **Prioritize mental health.** Therapy and emotional support can aid healing.  

**Conclusion**  
Survivors deserve justice, support, and healing. Together, we can create a society where no one suffers in silence. **Speak up. Educate. Stand against sexual violence.**
